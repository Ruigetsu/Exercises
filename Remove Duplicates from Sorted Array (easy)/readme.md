Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return number of unique element in nums. 

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things: 

Change the array nums such that the first k element of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as size of nums.

Return k.
